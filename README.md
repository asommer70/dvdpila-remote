# DVD Pila! Remote

A small remote control app for iOS and Android developed using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

## How It Works

DVD Pila! Remote controls what is currently playing in an instance of [DVD Pila!](https://github.com/asommer70/dvdpila) on your local LAN.

The app uses web sockets to retrieve data from the server and send control events back through to the browser playing the HTML5 video.
